SnowBrawl is a prototype of a battle-royal snowball-shooter game. 
You goal is to become the last player standing on a constantly shrinking round stage while trying to push all the enemies out of it with snowballs.
You have different types of snowballs in your arsenal: from regular ones to explosive snowball-mines that disguises themselves as a snowball your enemy can pick up.
